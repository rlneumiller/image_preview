# Image PreViewer

**This is a work in progress** aka: Don't blame me if it deletes everything you care about and\or corrupts any innocent bystanders

## The Goal
Create a simple(?) rust app using egui to preview images and svg's and ? in a safe, unobstrusive fashion

### TODO
- Consider making image loading async to free up the UI to be UI
- Folder\File browser
- Be more diligent about unit tests
- Confirm support for *nix variants

### Contributing
I wouldn't recommend it, but feel free to create an issue or submit a PR if you feel that you must

#### Thanks for watching
